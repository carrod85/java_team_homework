    //todo A
    // in your own words (do not use wiki definitions)
    // What is compilation?
    // Answer: the process of translating the language/code of Java into code understandble by the computer hardware to
    // processed.
    //
    //
    //
    //
    //todo B
    // Name 2 benefits of compilation?
    // Benefits:
    // 1 The languages that need to be compiled are considered faster than interpreted languages because they are
    // transfored into machine code so the code is optimized up to the maximum of the computer hardware ressources.
    // 2 You generally have more control over the management of memory, cpu usage.
    //
    //todo C
    // Name 1 disadvantage of compilation?
    // Disadvantage:
    // 1 Prone to issues of compatibility between different computer's architecture.
    //todo D
    // Name 2x other languages using compiler
    // 1 C
    // 2 C++
    //todo E
    // What is opposite of compiled language?
    // Answer: interpreted language (1 word)
    //todo F
    // Name 2x languages of E
    // 1 Java
    // 2 Python
